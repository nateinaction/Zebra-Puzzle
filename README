PROJECT DIRECTION:
* HIGH: I would like to visually indicate to the player whether they've selected a correct or incorrect answer.
* HIGH: I would like to congratulate a player who has successfully completed a puzzle with some fuzzy warm feelings and a summary of their score.
* MEDIUM: I would like to add a way of tracking scores, preferably through a social network tie-in like facebook or google plus.
* MEDIUM: I would like to add social aspects to the game i.e. achievements, multiplayer, cooperative, etc.
* LOW: I would like to redo the artwork as high resolution and use CSS sprites to reduce number of requests on page load.
* LOW: I would like to reward a player who has no incorrect guesses in a block.

VERSION HISTORY:
* 0.03:	Clues automatically generate until the puzzle is solvable.
* 0.02:	Clues are no longer allowed to repeat, clues now fail with console message when maximum number of possible clues is reached. The puzzle
				only generates if a minimum puzzle size of 3x4 is reached.
* 0.01:	Rewrote code in accordance with project appendix, clues can now be flagged.
* 0.00:	Fixed some spacing issues and testing git push.

PROJECT APPENDIX:
* GAME BOARD: The game board is the playing surface. It contains multiple rows and columns of blocks as well as all the clues.
* BLOCK: A block is single square on the game board. Blocks can be SOLVED consisting of a single correct tile, SOLVABLE consisting of all possible, impossible, and incorrect tiles, or UNSOLVABLE if the available clues do not provide enough information to solve the block.
* TILE: A tile is an object which resides in a block. It can be shown to the player in four distinct ways: TRUE when a tile is the correct answer in a block, FALSE when a tile is the incorrect answer in a block, FLAGGED-POSSIBLE when a tile is not flagged as an impossible answer in an unsolved block, and FLAGGED-IMPOSSIBLE when a tile is flagged as an impossible answer in an unsolved block.
* FLAGGED: A flagged tile or clue will become translucent on right click. Only tiles and clues can be flagged.
* CLUE: A clue is a hint as to the location of a tile. There are four types of clues between, near, directional, and vertical. Clues can be flagged or unflagged.
* game-board.js: The purpose of game-board.js is to randomize the answers, validate answers, and setup the HTML elements that make up the game board.
* user-input.js: The purpose of user-input.js is to process left clicks from the user into any CSS, score, or other game related changes.
