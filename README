PROJECT DIRECTION:
* CRITICAL: I would like to stop generating clues when the puzzle is solvable.
* CRITICAL: I would like to stop clues from repeating.
* HIGH: I would like to visually indicate to the player whether they've selected a correct or incorrect answer.
* HIGH: I would like to congratulate a player who has successfully completed a puzzle with some fuzzy warm feelings and a summary of their score.
* MEDIUM: I would like to add a way of tracking scores, preferably through a social network tie-in like facebook or google plus.
* MEDIUM: I would like to add social aspects to the game i.e. achievements, multiplayer, cooperative, etc.
* LOW: I would like to redo the artwork as high resolution and use CSS sprites to reduce number of requests on page load.
* LOW: I would like to reward a player who has no incorrect guesses in a block.

VERSION HISTORY:
* 0.01: Rewrote code in accordance with project appendix, clues can now be flagged.
* 0.00: Fixed some spacing issues and testing git push.

PROJECT APPENDIX:
* game board: The game board is the playing surface. It contains multiple rows and columns of blocks as well as all the clues.
* block: A block is single square on the game board. It can either be solved, consisting of a single tile, or unsolved, consisting of 6 small tiles. Blocks can also be solvable and unsolvable based on the available clues.
* tile: A tile is a playing piece on the game board. It can be shown to the player in four distinct ways: unsolved, solved, flagged, and incorrect.
* flagged: A flagged tile or clue will become translucent on right click. Only tiles and clues can be flagged.
* clue: A clue gives a hint as to the location of a tile. There are four types of clues between, near, directional, and vertical. Clues can be flagged or unflagged.
* game-board.js: The purpose of game-board.js is to randomize the answers, validate answers, and setup the HTML elements that make up the game board.
* user-input.js: The purpose of user-input.js is to process left clicks from the user into any CSS, score, or other game related changes.
